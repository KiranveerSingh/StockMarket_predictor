    üîπ What is the Stock Market?
             
        The stock market is a public platform that enables individuals and institutions to buy, sell, and trade shares (also known as stocks or equities) of publicly listed companies. It is a key component of the financial system, facilitating capital formation, investment, and economic growth.

    üîπ Key Concepts
             
        1. Stock:
            A stock represents a fractional ownership in a company. For example, if you own 100 shares of a company that has issued 1 million shares, you own 0.01% of that company.

        2. Shareholder:
            Anyone who owns at least one share of a company is called a shareholder, and they are entitled to a share of the company's profits (dividends) and voting rights.

        3. Stock Exchange:
            A stock exchange is a centralized marketplace where stocks are traded. In India, the two main exchanges are:
                BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) - Oldest in Asia, established in 1875
                NSE (National Stock Exchange) - Founded in 1992, introduced electronic trading

    üîπ How the Stock Market Works
             
        Company Listing:        A company goes public by issuing shares via an Initial Public Offering (IPO).

        Trading Begins:         Once listed, investors can buy or sell these shares through stock exchanges.

        Price Fluctuation:      Stock prices are determined by supply and demand, influenced by:
                                    Company performance
                                    Industry growth

        Economic indicators:    GDP, Inflation, Interest rates

        Market sentiment:       News, Rumors, Global trends

        Settlement:             After a trade, ownership is transferred within T+1 day in India.

    A Stock Market Prediction Interface is an intelligent, user-friendly tool designed to forecast future stock prices or market trends based on historical and real-time financial data. These interfaces combine data science, machine learning, and financial modeling to assist investors, traders, and analysts in making informed investment decisions.

    The primary goal of such a system is to analyze various factors that influence stock prices‚Äîsuch as past price trends, trading volume, technical indicators, economic news, and market sentiment‚Äîand use predictive algorithms to estimate future performance.

    This stock market prediction project and its associated user interface are for informational and educational purposes only.

    üö´ No Financial Advice: The predictions and outputs generated by this system are not intended as financial advice or recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any security or investment.

    ‚ùó No Guarantees: While the model uses advanced machine learning techniques and historical data, all predictions are subject to substantial uncertainty. Stock prices are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors, including market sentiment, economic events, and unforeseen company developments.

    üîÑ Past Performance Is Not Indicative of Future Results: Model accuracy on past data does not guarantee similar results in the future. Stock markets can experience volatility outside the scope of any model.

    üë§ User Responsibility: Users should always conduct their own research, consult with professional advisors, and consider their own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.

    st.header("Step Performed")
    st.write("""
    
    1. Problem Definition & Objectives:
             
            -Clearly define the prediction goal: ‚ÄúWill a given stock grow or fall on the next trading day?‚Äù.
             
            -Specify the end-user target, business value, and main deliverables: an interactive prediction app, model performance report, and investment insights.
    
    2. Data Acquisition:
             
            -Collect historical stock data (OHLCV: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for companies from trusted sources (e.g., NSE/BSE, Yahoo Finance).

            -Include additional columns if available: Prev Close, Deliverable Volume, %Deliverble, Trades, Turnover, VWAP, etc.
             
    3. Data Cleaning:
             
            -Standardize and rename columns for consistency.

            -Convert all string-based and mixed columns to appropriate numeric types (using error coercion).

            -Remove duplicates, invalid entries, and fill or drop missing values.

            -Parse and sort date columns chronologically for each symbol.
             
    4. Feature Engineering:
             
            -Generate key technical indicators: moving averages, RSI, daily returns, rolling volatility, volume ratios, and price ratios.

            -Compute and add lagged features (prior days‚Äô data) to capture temporal trends.

            -Engineer rolling statistics and ratios for new features such as Deliverable Volume, Trades, Turnover, VWAP, and %Deliverble.

            -Create the binary prediction target: Will_Grow = 1 if next day‚Äôs close > today‚Äôs, else 0.

            -Save the feature-enriched dataset for modeling.
             
    5. Data Preprocessing:
             
            -Split the data into training and testing sets chronologically to avoid data leakage.

            -Separate numeric and categorical columns for each sample.

            -One-hot encode categorical features and align columns for train/test consistency.

            -Apply feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler) to numeric features.

            -Save the fitted preprocessing objects (scaler, categorical column list) for use in live prediction.
             
    6. Model Development:
             
            -Train and compare multiple classification models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, etc.

            -Optionally compare regression models, thresholding their outputs for classification use.

            -Collect and compare performance metrics: accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

            -Select and export the best-performing model and log all model artifacts.
             
    7. Model Robustness Check:
             
            -Test the selected model on a new, unseen dataset processed with the identical pipeline.

            -Analyze results for consistency, overfitting, and generalization.

            -Adjust features or retrain if required based on performance drift.
             
    8. Unified Prediction Pipeline:
             
            -Integrate all steps into a single processing and prediction function.

            -Ensure future user or batch data flows through the same preprocessing and feature engineering as the training pipeline.

    9. User Interface (UI) Development:
             
            -Build an intuitive interactive application (Streamlit UI).
