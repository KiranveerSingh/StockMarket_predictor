    üîπ What is the Stock Market?
        The stock market is a public platform that enables individuals and institutions to buy, sell, and trade shares (also known as stocks or equities) of publicly listed companies. It is a key component of the financial system, facilitating capital formation, investment, and economic growth.

    üîπ Key Concepts
        1. Stock
            A stock represents a fractional ownership in a company. For example, if you own 100 shares of a company that has issued 1 million shares, you own 0.01% of that company.

        2. Shareholder
            Anyone who owns at least one share of a company is called a shareholder, and they are entitled to a share of the company's profits (dividends) and voting rights.

        3. Stock Exchange
            A stock exchange is a centralized marketplace where stocks are traded. In India, the two main exchanges are:

            BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) ‚Äì oldest in Asia, established in 1875

            NSE (National Stock Exchange) ‚Äì founded in 1992, introduced electronic trading

    üîπ How the Stock Market Works
        Company Listing: A company goes public by issuing shares via an Initial Public Offering (IPO).

        Trading Begins: Once listed, investors can buy or sell these shares through stock exchanges.

        Price Fluctuation: Stock prices are determined by supply and demand, influenced by:

        Company performance

        Industry growth

        Economic indicators (GDP, inflation, interest rates)

        Market sentiment (news, rumors, global trends)

        Settlement: After a trade, ownership is transferred within T+1 day in India.
